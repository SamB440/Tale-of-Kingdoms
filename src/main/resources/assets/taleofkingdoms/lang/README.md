# Translating
This is the folder containing all translations.

If you are submitting a new translation file, you must ensure that:

- The file name must be the language code. These can be found at https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language.
  - These are by standard ISO-639-1 codes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
- Translations must be as accurate as possible
- Translation files *must* contain all the key-value pairs in the en_us.json file (en_us is Minecraft default).

I will also be checking all translations myself when they are submitted.
